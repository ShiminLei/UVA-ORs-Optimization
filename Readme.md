## Introduction

The University of Virginia main facility Operating Room time optimization program.

Here is the part of the R codes including :

- `dataprocess.R` for data prepocessing.
- `SEM.R` for Structural Equation Model .
- `MC.R` for Monte Carlo Simulation.

# Requirement

1. Hmisc package
2. lavaan package
3. semPlot package
4. mvnormtest package
5. robustX package

# Data

The data cannot be given due to confidentiality agreement.

# Motivation & Method

-  Evaluate and optimize the Operating Room time utilization of UVA main facility with statistical modeling.
-  Do data visualization, time series analysis, build 3D system simulation model with Simio to explore the overutilization problem. 
-  Use Structural Equation Model to select the best model for fitting multicollinearity of time data.
-  Predict the best management scheme with Monte Carlo Simulation to decrease the variability of overutilized time.

**NOTE**: More details can be seen in [Presentation](OR-variability-Presentation.pdf).
